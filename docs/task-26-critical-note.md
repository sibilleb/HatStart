# CRITICAL: Task 26 Must Be Completed First

## Status
Task 26 is currently **IN PROGRESS** with 10 pending subtasks that MUST be completed before moving to any other tasks.

## Why This Is Critical
These subtasks are part of the MVP refactoring effort to reduce the codebase from ~50,000 to ~3,000 lines. Each subtask removes or simplifies over-engineered code that is blocking the project from being a true MVP.

## Pending Subtasks (Must Complete in Order)
- [x] 26.9: Remove unused dependency resolution system (DONE - removed 13,722 lines)
- [ ] 26.10: Fix version management UI disconnection
- [ ] 26.11: Delete tests for non-existent features  
- [ ] 26.12: Consolidate duplicate IDE configuration code
- [ ] 26.13: Simplify IPC handlers
- [ ] 26.14: Simplify manifest system
- [ ] 26.15: Simplify category installers
- [ ] 26.16: Simplify main UI
- [ ] 26.17: Simplify workspace generation
- [ ] 26.18: Update documentation
- [ ] 26.19: Cancel misaligned tasks

## Expected Impact
- Remove ~47,000 lines of unnecessary code
- Make the codebase maintainable
- Enable rapid feature development
- Deliver actual value to users

## DO NOT
- Start Task 16 (Conflict Resolution UI) or any other task until Task 26 is complete
- Add new features while refactoring
- Skip any subtasks - they all address critical issues

## Command to Continue
```bash
task-master next  # This should show Task 26.10
```
