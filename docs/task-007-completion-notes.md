# Task 7: Build Dependency Resolution Engine - Completion Notes

## Overview
Task 7 involved building a comprehensive dependency resolution engine for HatStart, enabling cross-category dependency management, conflict detection, and automated resolution. The engine integrates seamlessly with the CategoryInstaller framework and provides both programmatic and visual interfaces.

- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage tests

## Performance Metrics

- Graph building: < 500ms for 100 nodes
- Dependency resolution: < 200ms for 100 nodes
- Conflict detection: < 100ms typical
- Conflict resolution: < 1s for 50 conflicts
- Memory usage: < 100MB for 1000 nodes

## Integration Points

1. **CategoryInstaller Framework**: Full integration with dependency-aware installation
2. **Native Package Managers**: Query and integration with system package managers
3. **UI Components**: React components for visualization
4. **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for non-GUI usage
5. **Version Management**: Works with version manager system

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

1. **Linting**: ~160 linting errors remain (mostly unused imports)
2. **Real-world Testing**: Needs testing with actual package managers
3. **Performance**: Could benefit from WebWorker implementation for large graphs
4. **ML Integration**: Future enhancement for conflict prediction
